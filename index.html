    <p><strong>Bachelor’s Degree in Software Engineering</strong> (01/09/2023 – Present)</p>
    <p>
      Favorite course/memory: I especially enjoyed the courses where we built
      solid fundamentals (OOP, Design Patterns, and architecture basics) and
      connected theory to practical projects like PBL.
